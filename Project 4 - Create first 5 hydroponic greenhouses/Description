For this project we wanted to install 5 mini greenhouses to Nate' Saint Clairesville property.

Each greenhouse is 56"x30"x76" and serves as a quality greenhouse with both pest protection and frost protection

We will have 6 bins installed with a vertical grower inside each bin. Each vertical grower can hold 4 plants.

This totals for a total of 24 plants per greenhouse and 120 plants overall.

We will plant toatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, and potatoes
